              <p>Cancellation of orders made shall not be entertained once the payment has been made. No refunds will be processed except in the case of cancellation or non-performance of service by juststart.co.in itself.</p>
             
              <p>However, there might be situations when refund is desired by you. Such situations may be like when you have paid for the services but later on decided not to avail them because you have changed your mind. Secondly, when there is a delay on our part in providing the services to you on time for which juststart.co.in is solely responsible other than cases where delay is from government department or there is deficiency in the documents submitted by client. The other situation might arise when you found our services unsatisfactory. In all the aforementioned situations, you can send us an e-mail in regard to your complaint and a Ticket number/id will be generated in your name, and your complaint will be looked into deeply by the management. We do clarify that only refunds of the professional fees component of the charges paid by you shall be considered for a refund. Kindly note that the full refund will be made in the cases where delay or clientsâ€™ dissatisfaction is made out after scrutiny and professional fee will be charged as applicable where there is a change of mind.</p>

              <p>Upon receiving your complaint, the senior management at juststart.co.in will consider the matter and shall decide on whether your request for a refund is eligible to be processed or not. The decision of the Management will be final in case of any objection or complaint raised by you.</p>
              
              <p>Further, we would like to clarify that in case of Force Majeure, or any other reasons which are beyond our reasonable control such as war, Pandemics, Flood, fire, earthquake, riots, Power/internet interruption, technical glitch, hacking, Act of God etc., juststart.co.in shall not be liable for any refunds.</p>

              <p>Subject to the terms and conditions mentioned herein, your refund request will be processed within 72 working hours in your Bank Account.</p>
