<ul><li>A&nbsp;trademark is a type of&nbsp;intellectual property&nbsp;consisting of a recognizable&nbsp;sign,&nbsp;design, or&nbsp;expression&nbsp;which identifies&nbsp;products&nbsp;or&nbsp;services&nbsp;of a particular source from those of others.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Although trademarks used to identify services are usually called&nbsp;service marks.&nbsp;The trademark owner can be an individual,&nbsp;business organization, or any&nbsp;legal entity.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<ul><li>A trademark may be located on a&nbsp;package, a&nbsp;label, a&nbsp;voucher, or on the product itself. For the sake of&nbsp;corporate identity, trademarks are often displayed on company buildings. It is legally recognized as a type of&nbsp;intellectual property.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the source or origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, indicates the source or serves as a badge of origin.</li></ul>

<ul><li>A&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/limited-liability-partnership/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">limited liability Partnership</a></strong> (<strong>LLP</strong>) is a partnership in which some or all partners (depending on the jurisdiction) have limited liabilities. It therefore can exhibit elements of partnership and corporations.</li><li>In an LLP, each partner is not responsible or liable for another partner's misconduct or negligence. This is an important difference from the traditional partnership in which each partner has joint (but not several Liability) </li><li>In an LLP, some or all partners have a form of Limited Liability similar to that of the shareholders of a corporation. Unlike corporate shareholders,</li><li>The partners have the power to manage the business directly.</li><li>An LLP also contains a different level of tax liability from that of a corporation.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Disadvantages of an LLP Registration</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>As with all formats of business there will be disadvantages as well as advantages. The following may be considered disadvantageous in some cases.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Public disclosure is the main disadvantage of an LLP. Financial accounts have to be submitted to Companies House for the public record. The accounts may declare income of the members which they may not wish to be made public.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Income is personal income and is taxed accordingly. There may be tax advantages in registering as a company, but this will depend on your personal circumstances.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Profit can not be retained in the same way as a company limited by shares. This means all earned profit is effectively distributed with no flexibility to hold over profit to a future tax year.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>An LLP must have at least two members. If one member chooses to leave the partnership the LLP may have to be dissolved.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Residential addresses were historically recorded at Companies House. Whilst the use of ‘service addresses’ now allows for home addresses to be kept out of public view, any address previously supplied to Companies House is still part of the public record unless you pay for the records to be suppressed. For many businesses this is not a problem. However, there are some examples where this may not be desired. Consider solicitors and partners of law firms that may not want their home address so freely available if their work involves sensitive cases.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>This is not an exhaustive list but covers some of the key issues that some may feel are disadvantageous for an LLP.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong><u>Documents required</u> for LLP Registration</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<p>A Trademark (<a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/trademark-registration/""><strong>Trademark Registration</strong></a>) is a special symbol, design, or name that a company puts on its products that cannot be used by any other company. It is a complex and long process that is registered through payment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the whole process, sometimes we make mistakes that are hard to change. To avoid these irregular changes, you should avoid these common mistakes to protect your business in the long run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""types-of-trademarks"">Types of Trademarks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""1-generic-trademark"">1. Generic Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A generic trademark is a type of mark in which it is identified with the type of product or service in people's minds. For example, shoes or cold drinks are generic trademarks as they qualify the simple terms of it. It is identified through the product and not for a particular brand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2-suggestive-trademark"">2. Suggestive Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A suggestive trademark is a type of mark that is identified through the nature and the quality of the product or service. For example, Netflix and Microsoft are known for their service and the mere quality they provide through their products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3-arbitrary-trademark"">3. Arbitrary Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbitrary trademarks are the type of marks that are far way different than their actual product or service. It gives a different meaning to their brand. For example, Apple and Camel are some examples of this as they are unique and different compared to the type of service they provide to the people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""4-fanciful-trademarks"">4. Fanciful Trademarks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fanciful trademarks are the type of marks that are adopted and have a new meaning behind them. They are made to create a separate space specifically for the audience they are aiming for. For example, Adidas and Lexus are some great examples of this. </p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""mistakes-to-avoid"">MISTAKES TO AVOID</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""1-don-t-violate-other-s-trademark"">1. Don't Violate Other's Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing while registering for your trademark is to check whether you haven't violated anyone's rights. This may cause harm to your business reputation and the original trademark owner can file a lawsuit against you to pay the damages that occurred to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent case, where Adidas filed a lawsuit against Forever 21 alleging that their three-striped design products are similar to the products in which they have invested millions of money. To avoid this to happen, you can check the availability of the name of your trademark on <a href=""http://ipindiaonline.gov.in"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ipindiaonline.gov.in</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2-don-t-use-generic-words-as-your-trademark"">2. Don't Use Generic Words as Your Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generic words are not protected by trademark law anywhere in India which is the biggest limitation for your business. It is usually ignored by many business owners as it affects the reputation of your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The high court has ruled that common and simple English words cannot be used as trademarks. By using a generic word, it losses the value of the particular product or service and the advertising becomes harder to be done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3-maintaining-the-ownership"">3.  Maintaining the Ownership</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to take proper care of your trademark and use it only for the purpose it was registered for your business. Make sure that you keep a check on the expiry date and renewal of it. If in any way the owner fails to recognize the expiry date and does not file an application for the renewal, he may lose all the rights given to him during the registration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""4-usage-of-the-trademark"">4. Usage of the Trademark</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the registration of the trademark for your business, make sure that you use it properly. It is only valid for 10 years and if you do not use it for the first five years, it can be cancelled at any given point. To avoid this use your trademark as a proper adjective as per the guidelines and highlight it to be seen by others.</p>

<p>Whenever the term business comes to our mind, the first thing we think about is profit. Therefore, we expect higher returns as soon as we <strong><a href=""https://startupstartkaro.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">start our business</a></strong>. But starting something takes a little time to expand. So, focus on your work more instead of having higher expectations in return. This will give your mind space to think about new ideas to generate more profits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>3. Hire the Right People</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To know what you want and what you get are completely two different things. Being the owner or entrepreneur of your business, you need to delegate the task properly. For this, you should hire the right people for the right job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create a list of the skills you want for a particular position in your office and hire the people according to it. The right people will help you increase the growth of your sales as well as will continue to maintain a healthy workplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Keep Your Why Strong</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The struggle of why you started in the first place is completely normal. When things do not go as we want, we often think about quitting. It is a part of the process of a new journey. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will always be ups and downs but the most important thing is to know why you started and where you want to go. So, whenever you doubt- yourself for your incapabilities look back and see how far you have come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Don't Try to Control Everything</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever we start something new, the first thing that comes to our mind is to make sure that everything goes our way. In order to do that sometimes, we get to control the things that are not in our hands and lose all the power and energy to make things better for us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is natural to make mistakes in doing something out of your way. So, Instead of complaining and stressing about it, try to accept it and find ways to make it right for you. There is not a silver button to reverse things, therefore the only thing you can do is put in the groundwork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>6. Eliminate Your Fears</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all have some fears which we are afraid to face especially when you are the CEO of the business. True leadership quality is to take action in the most difficult times and choose to work upon them. Through this, you will not only learn to handle things properly but it will also increase productivity in your workplace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>7. Change is Inevitable</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Business is not an invariable thing, it fluctuates according to several things that happen in the marketplace. You have to adapt to these changes in order to survive in the market for a long period of time as the needs of the business and the customers will change from time to time.</p>

2404,"6 Big Hidden Myths About a Business Industry","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting a business could be scary and difficult to handle as there are so many things you need to take care of. From establishing it to promoting it in the market. However, there are certain myths that stop or confuse you to get the correct information regarding your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we will cover all those myths so that you can focus on the more important things and prioritize your work properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Your Product is Enough</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of the biggest myths that we have covered in this industry. It doesn't matter how great your product or service is, if it does not reach your potential customers you will have nothing on your plate. So, to have high sales it is important to focus on marketing to make people aware of your business. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media is a great platform to show people how great your product or service is for the people. It will attract them towards knowing more about it, hence will increase your customers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Lack of Social Contacts can be a Limitation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creating multiple social contacts provide access to people and support leading to funding and investments. However, this is not certainly true. If you are starting new and have lesser contacts then you are in a position to build and create more things for your customers by doing short-term experiments. These will help you provide a space for growth and good competition with your competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. A Great Team Makes a Great Revenue</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2413,""width"":389,""height"":282,""sizeSlug"":""full"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full is-resized""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-02-at-12.51.57-PM-1.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2413"" width=""389"" height=""282""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is important to have a great team by your side, it cannot give you everything you need to generate great sales. A healthy relationship between the team members can make a better workplace but it is not just enough. You have to delegate the tasks properly and do some important work on your own to build the company's name. A great company should know when to take the possible action for better growth and a better reputation in the industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4.  You Need a High Experience</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even it's a job or business everyone loves to hear about the amount of experience you have to become better at it. Therefore, people ask numerous questions and give a lot of advice if you fail to have one. But it is not the only thing to start something of your own. There is always a starting point in acquiring a good experience. Everyone makes mistakes even if it's the one with the highest experience. You should learn from those mistakes and find ways to not repeat them again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. You Should Have a Unique Idea</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone wants a great idea to start a business that will provide them with a different place in the market. But you don't need a great idea to run your own business. Even if your idea is not unique it can grow with the other aspects that hold a great place in the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, there are thousands of mobile companies that are running their business perfectly without having a unique idea of their own. This myth will not only misguide you but will also create self-doubts in yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>6. You Need Higher Investments</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2414,""width"":390,""height"":243,""sizeSlug"":""full"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-full is-resized""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-02-at-12.55.31-PM.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2414"" width=""390"" height=""243""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of the biggest myths that need to talk more about as many people drop the idea to start their business just because they don't have enough money to start. But there are several other ways to start on your own and have also practically justified as many people have just established their business without having a high amount of money. Therefore, whatever your business idea is, take a step ahead and go for it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the big myths you need to consider before commencing your business. However, there may be more of it. let me know in the comments and don't let these myths fool you into creating something big for yourself.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While every business is established to earn profits and grow more and more, there are also chances of failures that we tend to avoid as we move forward.

<div class=""wp-block-column"" style=""flex-basis:100%""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some entrepreneurs get stuck in the cycle of failure by thinking about it all the time. You should spare your time and give space to the reason why it happened in the first place and find suitable solutions regarding it. Instead of thinking too much about the past, accept it and move on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if your company's sales are decreasing day by day. Instead of stressing and being sad about it focus on the main reason for it. Is it because your product lacks quality or you are not investing much in the marketing etc. There could be multiple reasons at the same time but our main goal is to get rid of it to control the situation better.</p>

<p>To make better decisions for your company when it is suffering from the biggest crisis, take decisions keeping your emotions aside. This will make you think like a business owner and not as an individual person. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep your personal life out of your business as it can affect your decision-making power and will also ruin the business empire that you have created after a lot of hard work and time investing in it.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""6-don-t-hesitate-to-take-risks"">6. Don't Hesitate to Take Risks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

2753,"5 Best Ways To Get The Most Out Of Your Product Or Service","<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite great planning, is your product still behind the schedule to complete everything. If yes then this article is for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everybody wants their product to be the best out of everyone in the market. They make different plans and do regular changes to bring out the perfect value for their customers. However, still, some business owners suffer from selling their products even after doing everything for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this, we will cover the important strategies to make your <a href=""https://startupstartkaro.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>product or service</strong></a> market friendly and better than your competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Promotion - Product or Service</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After presenting your best product or service, you need to make people notice it too. It needs to be highlighted everywhere on your social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIN to know about its existence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this, you have to create and plan a social media strategy about how you will find out your potential customers and make them aware of you. There are many social media tools that you can use to describe the quality of your product or service. It will not only help people know about the different qualities of your product but will also build a good reputation in the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try multiple things that your competitors won't do to make a good impression on your customers. For example, Swiggy and Zomato are huge competitors but Zomato has a large audience on social media because of their unique content. It helps them to hold onto the customers more because of their entertaining content and to increase sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""wp-block-image is-style-default""><figure class=""aligncenter size-full is-resized""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-10-at-12.43.46-PM-1.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2759"" width=""317"" height=""394""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Work On Feedback</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":2770,""sizeSlug"":""full"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-10-at-1.23.11-PM-2.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2770""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter how good your product is, it is always good to listen to your customers and ask for their feedback. Because they are the ones that will at last buy your product or service. Listen to what they are trying to communicate through it so that you can look after it and bring valuable changes to your product or service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this, you can make a questionnaire or a suggestion tool to let them know that you care about their opinion and thank them to make them feel important and validated. Make them believe in you and that you will do everything to give them the product or service that they actually want from you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Focus on Building a Connection</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":2769,""sizeSlug"":""full"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-10-at-1.52.24-PM-1.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2769""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people try to build a strong connection between them and the customers but they fail to understand that the main part of their business is what they are providing others for a living. They need to make a relationship between the brand and the customer so that they can trust them for anything and choose them over others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can do this through advertising or sending emails to your customers about any new information regarding your product or service and can also set up contests and giveaways to communicate with them more often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Tell Your Product Story</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's always a reason behind starting a big thing. You can tell your story too so that people can get to the root cause of your brand and understand what your company values are and how much you mean to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be totally honest and explain everything in detail about when and why you started this in the first place. This will build a strong image of your brand in the customer's minds and they will appreciate you more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Be Innovative</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center"",""id"":2768,""sizeSlug"":""full"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter size-full""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-10-at-3.56.36-PM.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2768""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the products and services are not different than their competitors. Therefore, in order to stand out from your competitors, you need to be unique in your own way be it your brand, packaging or marketing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improve your technologies through problem-solving techniques and outsourcing to achieve great success and develop a good position in the marketplace.</p>

<p>A partnership firm is an association of two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of the business. In this article, we will know about the Registration and Dissolution procedure of a partnership firm and its consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Registration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Application for registration</strong>:- The registration of a firm may be effected at any time by sending by post or delivering it to the registrar of the area in which any place of the business of the firm is situated or proposed to be situated, a statement in the prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fee, stating:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(a) The firm's name</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(b) The place or principal place of business of the firm.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(c) The names of any other places where the firm carries on business.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(d) The date when each partner joined the firm</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(e) The names in full and permanent addresses of the partners</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(f) The duration of the firm</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement shall be signed by all the partners, or by their agents specially authorized on this behalf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Each person signing the statement shall also verify it in the manner prescribed.</li><li>A firm name shall not contain any of the following words namely queen, king, emperor, royal, or patronage of government. Except when the state government signifies its consent to use such words as part of the firm name in writing.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the registrar is satisfied that the provisions of section 58 are duly complied with, he shall record an entry of the statement in a registrar called the registrar of firms and shall file the statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The firm when registered shall use the bracket and word registered immediately after its name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Late registration on payment of a penalty</strong>:- If the statement in respect of any firm is not sent or delivered to the registrar within the time, then the firm may be registered on payment, to the registrar, of a penalty of one hundred rupees per year of delay or a part thereof.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consequences Of Non-Registration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under English law, registration is compulsory. Therefore, there is a penalty for the non-registration of firms. But the Indian Partnership Act does not make the registration of firms compulsory nor does it impose any penalty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, non-registration of partnership gives rise to some disabilities. Although registration is not compulsory yet the consequences or disabilities of registration have persuasive pressure on their registration. The disabilities are as follows:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>No suit in a civil court by the </strong>firm or the other co-partners against the third party:- The firm or any other person on its behalf cannot take an action against the third party for breach of contract entered by the firm unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the registrar of firms as partners in the firm. In other words, a registered firm can only file a suit against a third-party and the person suing has been in the registrar of firms as a partner in the firm.</li><li>No relief to partners for set-off to claim:- If an action is brought against the firm by a third party, then neither the firm nor the partner can claim any set-off if the suit is valued for more than rupees hundred or pursue other proceedings to enforce the rights arising from any contract.</li><li>Aggrieved partner cannot take legal action against the other partner of the firm:- A partner of an unregistered firm is precluded to take any legal action against the firm or any person to have been a partner in the firm. But such a person may sue for dissolution of the firm and realization of his share in the firm's property, where the firm is dissolved.</li><li>Third-party can sue the firm:-In case of an unregistered firm, an action can be brought against the firm or by a third party.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The right of third parties to sue the firm or any other partner.</li><li>The right of partners to sue for dissolution of the firm or settlement of the accounts of a dissolved firm, or for the realization of the property of a dissolved firm.</li><li>The power of an official assignee, the receiver of the court to release property of insolvent partner and to take an action.</li><li>The right to sue or claim a set-off if the value of the suit does not exceed rupees hundred in value.</li><li>The right to sue and proceedings instituted by the legal representatives or heirs of the deceased partner of a firm for accounts of the firm or to realize the property of the firm.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Dissolution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the dissolution of a partnership between all partners of a firm is called dissolution. It means breaking up the relationship between partners of the firm under various circumstances contemplated by the act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Modes Of Dissolution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>1. Dissolution without the order of the court or voluntary dissolution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It consists of four types:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(i) Dissolution</strong> <strong>by agreement:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A firm may be dissolved with the consent of all the partners or under a contract between partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(ii) Compulsory dissolution</strong>:- A firm is compulsorily dissolved:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>By the adjudication of all the partners or of all the partners but one as insolvent</li><li>By the happening of any event which makes it unlawful for the business of the firm to be carried on or all the partners to carry it on in partnership.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when more than one separate adventure or undertaking is carried on by the firm, the illegality of one or more shall not of itself cause the dissolution of the firm in respect of its lawful adventure and undertakings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(iii) Dissolution on the happening of certain contingencies:-</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Subject to a contract between the partners, a firm may be dissolved on the following contingencies:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>By the adjudication of a partner as an insolvent.</li><li>By the death of a partner.</li><li>Where the firm is constituted to carry out one or more adventures or undertakings, then by completion thereof.</li><li>Where the firm is constituted for a fixed term, on the expiry of that form.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(iv) Dissolution by notice of partnership at will:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Where the partnership is at will, the firm may be dissolved by any power giving notice in writing to all the other partners of his intention to dissolve the firm.</li><li>In case the date is mentioned in the office, the firm is dissolved from the date mentioned in the notice as the date of discussion, or in case no date is mentioned, as from the date of the communication of the notice.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Dissolution by the court</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The court may at the suit of the partner, dissolve the firm on any of the following grounds:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(a) Insanity/unsound mind:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where the partner has become of unsound mind, the court may dissolve the firm on a suit of the other partners. Temporary sickness is no ground for the dissolution of the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(b) Permanent incapacity:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a partner other than the partner suing, has become in any way permanently incapable of performing his duties as a partner, then the court may dissolve the firm. Such permanent incapacity may result from physical disability or illness etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(c) Misconduct:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where a partner is guilty of conduct that is likely to affect prejudicially the carrying on of business, the court may order for dissolution of the firm. The misconduct doesn't need to include the conduct of the business. The important thing is the adverse effect of the misconduct on the business. In each case, the nature of business will decide whether an act is misconduct or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(iv) Persistent breach of agreement:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where a partner wilfully commits a breach of agreements relating to the management of affairs of the firm then the court may dissolve the firm. The following comes into a breach of contract:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Holding more cash than allowed</li><li>Refusal to show accounts despite repeated requests etc.</li><li>Keeping erroneous accounts</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(v) Transfer of interest:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Where a partner other than the partner suing has transferred the whole of his interest in the firm or to a third party or has allowed his share to be charged or sold by the court, in the arrears of land revenue due by the partner, the court may dissolve the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(f) Continuous/Perpetual losses:-</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where the business of the firm cannot be carried on except at a loss in the future, the court may dissolve the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>(g) Just and equitable grounds:-</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Where the court considers any other grounds or equitable to the dissolution of the firm, it may dissolve a firm. The following are the cases on just and equitable grounds:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Deadlock in the management</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Loss of substratum</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Gambling by a partner on a stock exchange</li><li>Where the partners are not on talking terms between them</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consequences of dissolution</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>1. Liability for acts of partners done after the dissolution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the dissolution of the firm, the partners continued to be liable as such to third parties for any act done by any of them. This would have been an act of the firm if done before the dissolution until public notice is given of the dissolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Provided that the estate of a partner who dies, or is insolvent, or who is not known to the person dealing with the firm to be a partner, retires from the firm is not liable for acts done after the date on which he ceases to be a partner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>2. Right of partners to have business wound up after the dissolution </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On dissolution of the firm, every partner or his representative is entitled as against all the other partners or their representatives to have the property of the firm applied in payment of the debts of the firm. And to have the surplus distributed among the partners or their representatives according to their rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>3. Continuing authority of partners for purposes of winding up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the dissolution of the firm the authority of each partner to bind the firm. The other mutual rights and obligations of the partners, are necessary to wind up the affairs of the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, the firm is in no case bound by the acts of the partner who has been adjudicated insolvent. But this provision does not affect the liability of any person who has knowingly permitted himself to be the partner of the insolvent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>4. Mode of settlement of partnership accounts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In settling the accounts of the firm after dissolution, the following rules shall be subject to agreement by the partners:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Losses including deficiencies of capital shall be paid first out of profits and next out of capital, by the partners individually in proportions in which they were entitled to share profits.</li><li>The assets of the firm including any sum contributed by the partners to make up for deficiencies of capital must be applied in the following manner:-</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(a) In paying the debts of the firm to third parties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(b) In paying each partner what is due to him from the capital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(c) In paying each partner what is due to him on account of capital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(d) The residue if any shall be divided among the partners in the proportions in which they share the profits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>5. Payment of firm debts and of separate debts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where there are joint debts due from the firm and also separate debts due from any partner:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>The property of the firm shall be applied in the first instance in payment of the debts of the firm. If there is any surplus, then the share of each partner shall be applied to the payment of his separate debts or paid to him.</li><li>The separate property of any other partner shall be applied first in the payment of hid separate debts.

2834,"7 Tips And Tricks To Build Your Brand On Social Media","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without social media, today's world would be a very different place. It showed us a new realm of possibilities and in exchange, we have changed what we want, need, and expect from it either it's our business or brand such as <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/""><strong>JustStart</strong></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why should you care? Social media's impact on the world changed the business environment forever, presenting unparalleled opportunities and permanently shifting customer expectations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not a question of whether you need to use social media in business if you prefer to remain profitable. What you need to know is how to keep up with changes in social media strategy and use these dynamic constantly evolving platforms to maximize your brand, influence, and credibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's take a look at the steps you need to cover to make your brand more big and more powerful than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Make a list of all the ways your business currently uses social media.</li><li>Take 10 minutes a day to browse new social media sites that look useful and get familiar with how they work.</li><li>Sort your ideas by the target audience you want to reach. Make notes on whether the new sites you are discovering increase your branding, influence, and credibility.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Create a Social Media Plan and Platform</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""linkTo"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped""><!-- wp:image {""id"":2836,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-16-at-12.00.41-PM.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2836""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to successfully showcase your brand on social media, you will need both a plan and a platform. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your plan is your strategy laying out a roadmap that helps you determine what you want to achieve and to measure your actions and goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your platform is the foundation from which you build your online credibility. It's the cumulative impact of all of your content and social media interactions that support your brand and extend your influence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what comes first the plan or the platform? Usually, it's a little of both evolving together. For someone just starting, creating a plan and platform simultaneously will likely keep you from heading down dead ends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Making it Happen</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What do you want from social media? If you are like most people, you have got several results in mind. The most common might include:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Gather prospective customers</strong></li><li><strong>Engage with the current customers </strong></li><li><strong>Raise your visibility as an expert</strong></li><li><strong>Draw the attention of media and influencers</strong></li><li><strong>Get people to sign up for your website, events or to buy your product </strong></li><li><strong>Demonstrate your influence by growing the number of people who like and follow your pages</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of these are valid expectations from your social media investment. Many people will achieve most of these goals within a certain period. But as you began it is important to prioritize your goals because it's easier to add one goal once the other is achieved than to pursue it all at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Your main goals to increase your brand value could be the following:-</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Identify your ideal audience and make a strategic social media plan to map out how to find and gather prospective customers.</strong></li><li><strong>Develop useful and interesting content to engage with the customers.</strong></li><li><strong>Plan your time and be present on social media and be consistently visible.</strong></li><li><strong>Like, share, and comment on good content from other pages. Follow other bloggers, influencers, or famous people in your niche and learn from what they do to grab the attention of the people.</strong></li><li><strong>Engage with your customers through stories by adding questions and polls.</strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These goals will not only help you find new customers but will also help you to build a strong connection with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Building Credibility</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""linkTo"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped""><!-- wp:image {""id"":2837,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->

<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before people buy from you, they need to know and trust you. <strong>Social media is a great way</strong> to reach individuals around the world in ways to get known, be liked, or gain trust. You need to plan various strategies and actions designed to gather your audience or potential customers and build your credibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to use interpersonal skills on social media to go on a long way. For this, ask questions that draw people out and them to talk about their needs, concerns, and desires. The most important thing is to be a good listener. Don.t lead with a sales pitch or be quick to ask for business. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give first whether it's a tip or a recommendation of a resource. Answer questions or suggest service providers and share useful content like links to articles and blog posts. Shift your social media in the direction of your qualifying questions, so that you continue to engage with the people who are truly interested in buying your product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let people experience your credibility and help them to like, know or trust you. When they will be ready, they will follow you or send you a message waiting to connect with you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Use the Power of Stories</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""linkTo"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped""><!-- wp:image {""id"":2839,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://juststart.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-16-at-12.56.38-PM.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2839""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best ways to engage with your customers is by sharing stories. People like stories and they feel more connected when the story is emotional and inspiring. Stories are powerful as they can help you differentiate from your competitors. They define you and your unique approach to the services you provide to them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After reading or listening to a story people will feel connected to it as they will find similarities between your journey and them. Use these stories to tell the special things about your brand and your audience will find you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Case studies, videos, before and after stories are all kinds of stories you can narrate to your customers. The best stories don't just share the outcome or the result, they also describe the journey, setbacks, obstacles, and mistakes that led them so far. When you show vulnerability, it helps other people to relate their own stories with you. A good story not just satisfies the reader but also describes what success emotionally means to each one of them. You can take the following steps to tell your stories:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Think about the clients you have achieved great outcomes and make a list of potential stories that you could tell.</li><li>Keep the budget challenge in your mind as you create these stories. Make the outcome of your services or product too good to pass up.</li><li>As you think about your satisfied clients, also make a list of people who would be ideal for your stories and approach them nicely.</li></ol>

<h2>5. The Mighty Three</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""linkTo"":""none""} -->

<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a dozen of social media sites that exist but it always comes down to three- <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Juststart.co.in/""><strong>Facebook</strong></a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/juststartech/""><strong>Twitter</strong></a>, and LinkedIn. They are the three main sites that have a large and diverse following. These three sites may be different from each other but each set is a tool to accomplish a similar goal through various styles of conversation and engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Facebook</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook is meant to be a conversation place and not a broadcast, so it is a great place to attract and engage with your clients in a way that leverages your credibility and reinforces your brand. This is a great opportunity to be creative and mix things up by sharing photos, text, and videos. You can also promote or boost your post through Facebook Ads Manager.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twitter is a great place for sharing quotes, one-liners, and observations about trends, topics, and new events. It's perfect for sharing a link for an interesting article, or your latest blog post or video. Share a survey, poll link, and discuss the results with your audience. You can also live tweet about the highlights of a presentation or a big project that you are working on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The news tweet on Twitter moves faster than the wall of Facebook. So, you can post once an hour on Twitter as it varies on every social media platform. Sharing quality content by people you admire helps your audience establish you as a giver and makes you win points with the people who are forwarding it. Your sources will return the favor by forwarding helpful content that you have created which will increase your visibility too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hashtags are another way to enhance the visibility of your posts. You can also watch the trending column for popular hashtags and use those to relate to your content. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>LinkedIn</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LinkedIn is a little different from Twitter and Facebook as it is a platform to showcase your professional skills and ability to spread awareness. You can create great visuals and post them to make a good impression on your customers. For your brand value to increase more you should get your employees and partners on board too. Another great way is to participate in other groups and update frequently.  </p>

<p>We all know that Instagram is an incredibly visually based platform which is why having a good brand is so important if you want to see growth. But a brand is so much more than just a pretty grid, it's about your voice, your message, and the audience that you are speaking to. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can post all of the beautifully designed graphics in the world but if you don't have a true brand backing it up, like the way you connect with your audience or the personality of your brand, you will not see any growth. But on the other hand, if you know how to represent better but don't have good graphics or profile it's still gonna be a problem for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are starting from the start or already at a certain place it's still important to build a more powerful and trustworthy brand. For this, you should ask these questions first:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Who do you wanna serve?</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>What do you do for them?</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Who are you as a brand?</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>How do you communicate?</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>How do you represent yourself?</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> You can try different strategies to engage like telling your audience to create content for you like them sharing pictures with your product and sharing it to get the attention of the customers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> You can also run contests, do collaborations with different people or a community, ask them questions that they find interesting, etc.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is basically a method where you take the 3 values that are important to you and 3 content pillars. You may release a video or you do anything in your business that reverts back to the three values that you have and the pillars and revolve your business around that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, the three values that I have for my business are high value. so every content that I produce and everything that I ever do whether it is free or paid it's a value of mine to make sure that it's always of high value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second one is transparency. So what I always value is making sure that every step of the way, no matter how big my audience gets or how much money I make, that I am always going to be transparent with my audience. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third value is energy. I always want to make sure that I maintain high energy and that I convey it on my social media platforms. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because these values are important to me I try to ingrain that in everything that I do within my business. Once you have identified these values, the next step is to look into the pillars. These should be the three content pillars that you want to be consistent in within your personal brand. It can be anything like social media, coaching, entrepreneurship, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you combine these, now you have a reminder for yourself of what you need to be consistent in. This will boost your consistency. </p>

3034,"6 Easy Steps On How To Build a Lifestyle Business","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have all heard the formula of reaching the American dream- go to a good college, get the right degree, find a job with a great company, put in 35 years, get a gold watch and retire. But does that accomplish anything beyond creating an income? Does the process address the larger issues of passion, purpose, and calling? Most probably not for several people in the workplace today. In the lifestyle business, you will see the dangers of working towards security.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it's been said that nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit than a man with a secure future. Security is not our friend. It's most likely to bury our adventurous spirit and our passion for being fully alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In lifestyle business. you will see that most people have two lives- the one they are living and the one they want to live. In this, you will get to know about the six steps that will move you from your purpose, freedom, cash, and the lifestyle you have been wanting.</p>

<!-- /wp:image --></figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first step to shifting towards the life that you want to live is to define what that life looks like. Then you have to build a roadmap for yourself that directs you from where you are and where you want to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Define what this means to you. What does your ideal lifestyle look like? What's your vision for the future? What your core values are? What legacy will you leave behind yourself? It gives you something to strive towards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After this, you have to decide the type of business you want to create which will enable new opportunities for you. Make a list of the characteristics and describe your ideal business which enables your ideal lifestyle. For this think about what your ideal routine looks like and work towards it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you know what your ideal day and lifestyle look like, you can proceed to determine the gaps. After this, you have to take some steps to turn it into a reality. You have to make a vision board and then look at where you currently are concerning the experience. Consider the following things to measure it:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>What logical steps do I need to follow? You can do research and find out how other people have accomplished these goals.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>What have those other people done to accomplish this goal? Find those people and ask for some suggestions and advice that they could give you.</strong></li><li><strong>Determine the expenses you need to accomplish those goals.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these points will now help you clarify your destination. After defining your destination, starting point, and the changes required, you have to combine them all into a single roadmap. Fix a timeline and layout for each goal, say 5 or 10 years. Now, divide these goals into small timeframes to achieve them on time. Set check-in points to reflect and evaluate the whole process by making some adjustments and planning out the next thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shift your focus to the right activities rather than doing the activities fast. It will help you clarify what's important in your life and will make your head in the right direction. With that, we can begin to implement everything that you need to start making progress on your goals.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can get meaningful goals that help you live with intention with specific actions or tasks. Start with the small changes and replace one thought or behavior every day to give time to yourself.

<p>Nexus was founded by these two twin sisters in 2019 and they are building something incredible.  They make bio-organic and biodegradable electric vehicles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, they both wanted to build electric vehicles but after doing a bit of research, they realized that India's electric vehicles space is still a tough market to get into especially for an early-stage startup. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They could see that most Indian consumers weren't impressed by electric vehicles. They took a long time to charge and their range isn't that great. Also, India doesn't have a native mind and refined lithium right now which makes Indian electric vehicles expensive because the lithium that's in their batteries needs to be imported into India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, Nishita and Nikita decided to fix this. They thought if lithium isn't a great option for India then maybe they can create an alternative kind of battery. These batteries use bio-organic nano-materials with fast regenerative properties. These batteries are also biodegradable and fully recyclable. </p>

<p>Suchita Salwan started to write on little black bool [LBB] which initiates as a tumbler blog first, in which she documented interesting places that she had discovered in Delhi. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She once said ""It was me finding a way to make my life more interesting. It was a way for me to discover my city on my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By sharing these hidden gems with her followers, she was able to mass a pretty solid following. Eventually, LBB became a proper website and Suchita started to build a small team of employees, freelancers, and interns who would scour Delhi searching for interesting places that people could visit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a while, she realized that she wanted her company to be more than just a discovery website. So, in 2015 Dhruv Mathur joined her as a co-founder. Today more than 60000 brands showcase and advertise their products on LBB. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The platform also enables them to chat with their customers and access fully managed catalog, logistics, and payout services. LLB is used by 3 million consumers every month and has a presence across 8 Indian cities. </p>

<p>Shraddha founded Yourstory in 2008 after working in the Times of India and CNBC TV. According to her, a month before launching the Yourstory website she told the gathering of Entrepreneurs that she is going to start a venture which will tell stories of Entrepreneurs who are not superstars yet. But they have the spark, drive, and hope. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Few Entrepreneurs said to do it. Most of the experts present said that it won't work. But she decided to start up anyway. She was like the people that whom she was sharing the stories. Not yet the superstar but she had the spark, drive and hope to become one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first 7 years of building Yourstory shraddha and her team bootstrapped this start-up she said that part of this was because not a lot of investors were interested in funding a media and news start-up like Yourstory in the early days. But that also bootstrapping has made her the person she is today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you know you have to fend for yourself every inch of the way it gives you a different kind of grit and tenacity. In 2015 Yourstory did raise funds so that she could achieve her vision of making every story matter. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today Yourstory has been published in close to 60,000 stories of Indian Entrepreneurs and has helped more than 50,000 Entrepreneurs access networking and funding opportunities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They also host India's biggest and most popular startup submit tech sparks. They also have a section of their website dedicated to Women Entrepreneurs and change-makers called her story.</p>

<p>Upasana founded MobiKwik with Bipin Preet Singh in 2008. This start-up was founded before Paytm, free charge or google pay. It was early in the digital payments and fintech space. So They had to do a lot of heavy lifting to educate the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People just didn't trust the internet they wanted their money in cash not in some digital wallet. Mobikwik started as a prepaid recharge service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2012 MobiKwik started to branch out allowing its users to pay for bills like electricity, insurance, and gas. They even set up a small shopping service where users could buy items from platforms like eBay using their MobiKwik wallets. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>A <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/limited-liability-partnership/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Limited Liability Partnership</strong></a> is a new form of business entity with limited liability. It is an alternative corporate business vehicle that not only gives the benefits of limited liability at a low compliance cost but allows its partners the flexibility of organizing their internal structure as a traditional partnership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""characteristics"">Characteristics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""1-llp-is-a-body-corporate"">1. LLP is a body corporate</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Section(1) (d) of the limited liability partnership act, 2008 provides that an LLP is a body corporate formatted and incorporated under this Act and is a legal entity separate from that of its partners and shall have perpetual succession. Therefore, any changes in the partners of an LLP shall not affect the existence, rights, or liabilities of the LLP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Section 3 of the limited liability partnership Act provides that an LLP is a body corporate formed and incorporated under this Act and is a legal entity separate from that of its partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2-perpetual-succession"">2. Perpetual succession</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The LLP can continue its existence irrespective of changes in partners. Death, insolvency, the retirement of partners has no impact on the existence of it. It is capable of entering into contracts and holding property on its own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3-separate-legal-entity"">3. Separate Legal Entity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The limited liability partnership has a separate legal entity, is liable to the full extent of its assets but the liability of the partners is limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP. In other words, the creditors of a limited liability partnership shall be the creditors of it alone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""4-mutual-agency"">4. Mutual Agency</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No partner is liable on account of the independent or unauthorized actions of other partners, thus individual partners are shielded from joint liability created by another partner's wrongful business decisions or misconduct. In other words,  all partners will be agents of limited liability partnership. No one partner can bind the other partners by his acts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""5-llp-agreement"">5. LLP Agreement</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mutual rights and duties of the partners within a limited liability partnership are governed by an agreement between the partners. The LLP Act, 2008 provides flexibility to the partner to devise the agreement as per their choice. In the absence of any such agreement. the mutual rights and duties shall be governed by the provisions of the LLP Act, 2008. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""6-artificial-legal-person"">6. Artificial Legal Person</h2>

It can do everything which any natural person can do, except it cannot be sent to jail, cannot take an oath, marry, or get divorced nor can it practice a learned profession like CA or medicine. An LLP is invisible, intangible, immortal, but not fictitious because it exists. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Intellectual Property laws, along with courts decisions and regulations, establish rules for the following activities-</p>

<ul><li><strong>Registration and administration of intellectual property</strong></li><li><strong>Selling or licensing of intellectual property</strong></li><li><strong>Resolving disputes between companies making or selling similar intellectual property products or services.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intellectual property laws don't prevent someone from stepping on an owner's rights. But the laws do give the owner ammunition with which to take a trespasser to court. This is the most well-known benefit of owning intellectual property. The owner acquires exclusive rights and can file a lawsuit to stop others who use the property without authorization. If the intellectual property owner does not confront the person or company who has acted without permission, the illegal activity will likely continue. </p>

<h2>Patent law establishes three types of patents</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Utility patents</strong> are awarded for new processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter. The utility patent owner has the exclusive right to make, use and sell the invitation for a limited term. It expires 20 years after the date the application was filled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Design patents</strong> are awarded to new nonfunctional, ornamental, or aesthetic design elements of an invention or product. A design patent lasts 15 years from issuance if it was filed on or after May 13, 2015. If filed before that date it lasts 14 years from issuance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Plant patents</strong> are granted for new asexually reproducible plants. A plant patent expires 20 years from the date the patent was filed.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Copyright law</strong> protect expressions of creative ideas such as songs, artwork, writing, films, architecture, and video games. It does not protect ideas and facts, only the manner in which those facts and ideas are expressed. Copyright protection lasts a long time often more than 100 years.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Trademark law </strong>protects marketing signifies such as the name of the product or service or the symbols, logos, shapes, designs, sounds, and smells used to identify it. This protection can last as long as the company continuously uses the trademark in commerce- for example, many trademarks such as Coca-Cola and General Mills, have been protected for over a century. </li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Trade secret law</strong> commonly protects confidential designs, devices, processes, compositions, techniques, information, or recipes. A trade secret is any confidential information that gives a business a competitive advantage. The owner of this confidential information can prevent others from using the information if it was obtained legally under trade law. Trade secret protection lasts for as long as the business maintains the secret.</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes trade secrets, copyright, and <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/trademark-objection-reply/""><strong>trademark laws intersect</strong></a> with respect to a particular product or service. Some common examples of this are as follows:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Trade secret and patent-</strong> It is possible to pursue a patent application while simultaneously maintaining the invention as a trade secret at least for the first 18 months of the Indian application process. The Indian patent and trademark office regards applications as confidential until they are published. Unless the applicant files a Nonpublication request at the time of filing and doesn't file for a patent outside India, the PTO will publish the application within 18 months of the filing date.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Copyright and trademark-</strong> It's not uncommon for an item to be protected under both trademark and copyright law. For example, the expressive artwork in a package design might be protected by copyright while the overall look and feel of the package might be protected as a form of trademark. Likewise, an advertising commercial might include some material covered by copyright and other material covered by trademark. The difference here is that copyright protects the literal expression whereas trademark protects whatever is used to designate the source of a product or service being offered in the marketplace.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Patent, copyright,</strong> and trademark- Patent law can intersect with copyright and trademark law in the case of certain products. For example, the designer of a toy or jewellery may protect the device's name or appearance of any artwork or graphics and the novel nonobvious functionality of the device.                                                                                                            </li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A minor cannot be bound by a contract because a minor's contract is void and not merely voidable. Therefore a minor cannot become a partner in a firm because the partnership is founded on a contract. Though a minor cannot be a partner in a firm, he can nonetheless be admitted to the benefits of the partnership. In other words, he can validly give a share in the partnership profits. When this has been done and it can be done with the consent of all the partners then the rights and liabilities of such a partner will be governed as follows-</p>

3250,"Relation Of Partners Under The Partnership Act, 1932","<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Relation of Partners to one another</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The partnership Act contains various provisions regulating the relationship between partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>1. General Duties of Partners</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Partners are bound to carry on the business of the firm to the greatest common advantage, to be just and faithful to each other. To render true accounts and full information of all things affecting the firm to any partner or his legal representative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The partners should carry business of the firm to the greatest common advantages. Later they should render to any partner or his legal representatives full information of all things affecting the firm. A partner must observe the utmost good faith in his dealings with the other partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the partners are bound to render accounts to each other. But where some of the accounts are kept by one of them, prima facie he would be the proper person to explain and give full information about them.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An act of a partner imputable to the firm or the principles of agency, which is a fraud on his co-partners, entitles the co-partners as between themselves to throw the whole of the consequences upon him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>3. Determination of Rights and Duties of Partners by Contract Between the Partners</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Agreements in restraint of trade- Notwithstanding anything contained in section 27 of the Indian contract act, 1872 such contracts may provide that a partner shall not carry on any business other than of the firm while he is a partner. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>4. The conduct of the Business</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Subject to contract between the partners-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every partner has a right to take part in the conduct of the business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(b) Every partner is bound to attend diligently to his duties in the conduct of the business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(c) Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the business may be decided by a majority of the partners. Every partner shall have the right to express his opinion before the matter is decided. But no change may be made in the nature of the business without the consent of all the partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(d) Every partner has a right to have access, to inspect and copy any of the books of the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(e) In the event of the death of a partner, his heirs or legal representatives or their duly authorized agents shall have a right of access to and to inspect and copy any of the books of the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>5. Mutual Rights and Liabilities</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Subject to contract between the partners-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The partners are entitled to share equally in the profits earned. And shall contribute equally to the losses sustained by the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where a partner is entitled to interest on the capital subscribed by him such interest shall be payable only out of profits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The firm shall indemnify a partner in respect of payments made and liabilities incurred by him-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>In the ordinary and proper conduct of the business.</li><li>In doing such an act, in an emergency for the purposes of protecting the firm from loss, as would be done by a person of ordinary prudence in his own case under similar circumstances.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A partner making for the purposes of the business, any payment or advance beyond the amount of capital he has agreed to subscribe to, is entitled to interest thereon at the rate of 6 percent per annum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A partner shall indemnify the firm for any loss caused to it by his willful neglect in the conduct of the business of the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Relation of Partners to Third Parties</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>1. Partner to be Agent of the firm-</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Subject to provisions of this Act, a partner is an agent of the firm for purposes of the business of the firm. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A partnership is a relationship between partners who have agreed to share the profits of the business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Any of the partners can be the agent of the others. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Section 18 clarifies this position by providing that, subject to the provisions of the Act. A partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm. The partner indeed virtually embraces the character of both a principal and an agent. So far as he acts for himself and in his own interest in the common concern of the partnership. He may properly be deemed a principal and so far as he acts for his partners, he may properly be deemed as an agent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The principal distinction between him and a mere agent is that he has a community of interest with other partners in the whole property and business and <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/limited-liability-partnership/""><strong>liabilities of the partnership</strong></a>. Whereas an agent as such has no interest in either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rule that a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm cannot be applied to all the transactions and dealings between the partners themselves. It is applicable only to the act done by partners for the purpose of the business of the firm. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>2. Implied authority of partner as agent of the firm-</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Subject to the provisions the act of a partner which is done to carry on, in usual, the business of the kind carried on by the firm, binds the firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The authority of a partner to bind the firm conferred by this section is called his implied authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the absence of usage or custom of trade to the contrary, the implied authority of a partner does not empower him-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>To submit a dispute relating to the business of the firm to arbitration.</strong></li><li><strong>Open a banking account on behalf of the firm in his own name.</strong></li><li><strong>Compromise or relinquish any claim or portion of a claim by the firm.</strong></li><li><strong>Withdraw a suit or proceeding filed on behalf of the firm.</strong></li><li><strong>Admit any liability in a suit or proceedings against the firm.</strong></li><li><strong>Acquire immovable property on behalf of the firm.</strong></li><li><strong>Transfer immovable property belonging to the firm.</strong></li><li><strong>Enter into partnership on behalf of the firm.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Mode of doing act to bind the firm</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to bind a firm, an act is executed by a partner or other person on behalf of the firm. It shall be done or executed in the firm name, or in any other manner expressing or implying an intention to bind the network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>3. Extension and restriction of partners 'Implied authority'</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to section 20, the partners in a firm may, by contract between the partners, extend or restrict the implied authority of any partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notwithstanding any such restriction, any act done by a partner on behalf of the firm which falls within his implied authority binds the firm. Unless the person with whom he is dealing knows of the restriction or does not know or believe that partner to be a partner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>4. Partner's authority in an emergency</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A partner has authority in an emergency to do all acts for the purpose of protecting the firm from loss. As would be done by a person of ordinary prudence, in his own case, acting under similar circumstances and such acts bind the firm.</p>

3284,"Crowdfunding - Definition, Types and Valuation","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowdfunding is an innovative and relatively new concept that connects investors to entrepreneurs. It is a method of fundraising based on the ability to pool money from individuals in order to turn promising ideas into an actual business. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowdfunding is attractive to startups as an alternative funding source and offers non-monetary resources through organizational learning. It encompasses the outsourcing of an organizational function, through IT, to a strategically defined network of actors that is the crowd in the form of an open call specifically requesting monetary contributions toward a commercial or social business goal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is presently growing fast and this growth will probably be magnified after the anticipated changes in the law are made. Due to the novelty of the approach, several problems and fears arise that might lead to an underestimation of the approach and possibly missed opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonetheless, many startups are hesitant to consider it because little guidance exists on how the various types of crowdfunding add value in different life cycle stages and which type is best suited for which stage. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking a look at it through the prism of the SWOT analysis allows obtaining a comprehensive picture of the subject. The strengths of crowdfunding are-</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""1-equity"">1. Equity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equity crowdfunding is a method of raising capital used by startups. It is also known as crowd investing. Essentially equity crowdfunding offers the company's securities to a number of potential investors in exchange of financing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""2-reward"">2. Reward</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reward crowdfunding is a form of crowdfunding where the creators of a new product or service, or business solicit a large number of people for capital in exchange for the promise of a reward. Most often these rewards are the product or service that the campaign was created to fund.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""3-donation"">3. Donation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donation based crowdfunding is all about raising funds from individuals to support personal or social causes with no financial returns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""4-debt"">4. Debt</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debt crowdfunding is the practice of raising funds from individuals, in return for interest. An investor is a person who supports your project by putting in his money. In the other words, debt-based crowdfunding is also known as crowdlending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""crowdfunding-and-value-creation"">Crowdfunding and Value Creation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowd investors have different mechanisms to access the initiatives or ventures that they seek to finance. Most individuals from the crowd are not sophisticated investors and they avoid evaluating business plans, cash flow liquidity, and collateral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However as crowdfunding becomes more mainstream, individuals in the crowd are becoming more selective in their investments. Many traditional investors are utilizing this mechanism to make their investments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of social ventures crowdfunding investors are often driven by the purpose and value creation goals of the social venture. Social ventures create different types of economic and social value. They generate social value by helping society or the environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social ventures create varying levels of economic and social value according to their missions, visions, and internal goals. Depending on the respective importance of economic and social value creation for a social venture, the type of crowdfunding platform may vary. Choosing the appropriate crowdfunding model is important for a social venture so that they best focus on their efforts to raise financing for a program or initiative.</p>

<h2 id=""advantages-of-gst"">Advantages of GST</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>GST is structured to simplify the current indirect system by removing multiple taxes.</li><li>It taxes goods and services at the same rates so many disputes are eliminated on tax matter.</li><li>GST will be levied at the final destination of consumption based on the VAT principle and not at various points. This will help in removing economic distortions and bring about the development of a common national market.</li><li>The procedural cost is reduced due to uniform accounting namely, CGST, SGST, IGST have to be maintained for all types of taxes.</li><li>The reduced tax burden on companies will reduce production costs making exporters more competitive at the national and international level.</li><li>More business entities including the unorganized will come under the tax system thus widening the tax base. This may lead to better and more tax revenue collections.</li><li>Many businesses create depots and go down in different states simply because there is a difference in tax rates.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""disadvantages-of-gst"">Disadvantages of GST</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>There will be dual control of every business by the central and state governments. So compliance cost will go up.</li><li>All credit will be available on from online connectivity with the GST network. Hence small businesses may find it difficult to use the system.</li><li>VAT and service tax on some products may become higher than the current levels.</li><li>Manufacturing states would loose big revenue.</li><li>The service sector may oppose it because they have to register in every state with central and state governments. So every business at all India levels will have around 60 registrations while they are having just one today. Moreover, their rates will also go up.</li><li>A retail business may oppose it because their taxes will go up and they will also have to deal with the central government now in addition to sales.</li><li>GSTN may not work optimally for quite some time.</li></ol>

<h2 id=""gst-will-improve-the-ease-of-starting-a-business-in-india"">GST will improve the ease of starting a business in India</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While starting a new business in India, businesses currently have to get VAT registration from the state's sales tax department. Since each state has different procedures and fees for VAT registration, it is hard for businesses operating in multiple states to obtain and maintain compliance with VAT regulations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the implementation of GST in India, the procedure of <strong>GST registration</strong> would be centralized and standardized similar to service tax registration. Under the GST regime, businesses would no longer have to obtain multiple VAT registration as a single <strong>GST registration</strong> would be applicable across India. The procedure for obtaining GST registration would also be standardized thereby improving the ease of starting a business in India. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Integration of multiple taxes in GST currently goods and products are taxed under the VAT regime implemented by state government. Services are taxed under the service tax regimen implemented by the central government. As VAT is implemented by state governments, each state has different VAT rates, VAT regulations, and VAT procedures leading to complications. Further, in addition to VAT and service tax, there are various tax regulations that businesses must comply with the central sales tax, additional customs duty, purchase tax, luxury tax, etc.</p>

<h3>Problems and Conclusions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India declared 2010-20 as the decade of innovation. Innovation is the key for startup ecosystems and results in more industrialization. That increases the per capita income of a country. But the great problems in Indian markets are that they are unorganized and fragmented. There is a lack of transparent policy motives, lack of communication sources, and lack of knowledge and exposure. Startup systems require a combination of friendly, operational, regulatory, and taxation issues that affects the working of the business environment very much. For building an entrepreneurial environment, the government, big corporations, and educational institutions should come forward to provide a culture for startups in India. Mentor programs, innovative essay competitions, and workshops should be organized by the government and universities. From an overall view, India has a very high scope for the growth of startup ecosystems. India offers the largest pie of venture prospects that the world is eyeing.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women in India are at the epiphany stage of entrepreneurship and have an incremental success rate. But it doesn't mean that they don't have any problems or hurdles to face. While there is increased social acceptance of women as an entrepreneur in society, they still face fewer difficulties like not being taken seriously, fear of success, and funding to scale up their ideas. These and the additional following problems collectively form a recipe to accelerate the success of women entrepreneurs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Fund Raising Problem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things have changed so far over the years. Today, investors look at women as other co-founders but still face greater obstacles than men when starting and growing a business. It's important to note that women-owned startups are statistically less likely to receive funding than those owned by men. In order to counter this, women should be confident and show the investors that they are committed to the idea and let the product speak for itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Not Being Taken Seriously</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the business world, women's opinions and advice are not always viewed as experts as compared to man's opinions. And when a female starts a business, sometimes family, friends and others in the business community can view it as a hobby or a side project to family duties, rather than a bona fide business. Seeking out extra support can help to overcome this bias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the startup ecosystem, it can be said that today India is in a better position. Wherein participation in the field of entrepreneurship is increasing at a considerable rate. Startup India by the prime minister of India has brought lots of positivity among the women entrepreneurs in India. Efforts are being taken by the government for equality of opportunity in all spheres for Indian women. The laws that guaranteed equal rights of participation in education and employment were enacted. At this stage, effective steps are needed to be taken for entrepreneurial awareness, orientation, and skill development programs for women.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the environment is changing very fast, investors start investing in women's leadership and their contribution to economic development is also being recognized and increasing at a considerable rate. Startup India, is an initiative by the government to promote the culture of entrepreneurship by educating women about their hidden potential and strengths through entrepreneurship through their creative and innovative ideas. It is to make them realize their important position in society and how they can contribute to the entire economy of the country.</p>

3309,"6 Best Financial Bootstrapping Techniques In Startups","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many entrepreneurs who are building new economy businesses are choosing to bootstrap their startups either by using personal savings or reinvesting revenue earned. They stay away from equity just like many in the old economy stay away from debt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bootstrapping describes a situation in which an entrepreneur starts a company with little capital, relying on money other than outside investments. An individual is said to be bootstrapping when he/she attempts to found and build a company from personal finances. Or the operating revenues of the new company. Bootstrapping is also described as a procedure used to calculate the zero-coupon yield curve from market figures. Following are some of the bootstrapping techniques:-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""1-owner-s-assets"">1. Owner's Assets</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entrepreneurs have been using their assets such as marketable securities, real estate, and income from other sources such as a spouse or other employment, the foregoing of salary withdrawal, and the use of their homes to run a business. These techniques are usually the first place the entrepreneur looks to raise capital for some good reasons. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reasons include no dilution of ownership and maintained control of any future reimbursement at the entrepreneur's discretion. The techniques do lend themselves to high risk because the sources are personal and can be lost if the business fails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2-personal-borrowing"">2. Personal Borrowing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many<strong> <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/"">startup businesses</a></strong> have limited or no access to traditional bank lending due to their small size, limited collateral, and unproven business plan or expertise. Banks and other lenders have not recognized most new businesses as unique entities. Because many or most new ventures have not been formed as corporations, the only business forms have been recognized as unique entities. Most entrepreneurs resort to personal credit such as a second mortgage on their private homes, equity lines of credit, and the use of personal credit cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3-delaying-payables"">3. Delaying Payables</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A technique used for short-term borrowing is taking a loan from the suppliers by delaying payments to them. The supplier sends the raw material or service to the entrepreneur who can use it to generate a sale. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the sale is converted to cash and the payment has not been made to the supplier, then the entrepreneur is in essence taking a short-term loan out from the supplier. This may be more due to the entrepreneur being short on cash and stretching the bill payment as long as possible until the cash comes in. Other payables may be taxes and utilities and in some cases even employee salaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""4-minimizing-receivables"">4. Minimizing Receivables</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the payables delay to have a maximum effect, the entrepreneur needs to collect their payments from customers soon. This creates a maximum float period which is the time between collection and payment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Some techniques that are used include targeting customers who have a history of paying quickly, obtaining prepayments, speed up the invoicing process. Also, charge interest on overdue accounts, and sell the receivables to a third party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""5-minimal-asset-cost"">5. Minimal Asset Cost</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Techniques used here attempt to acquire the use of assets at a minimum cost to the entrepreneur. These may include the buying of used equipment, the use of temporary employees with other businesses using business incubators for office spacer, and using government resources to assist with expertise and advice. The entrepreneur is mainly concerned with preserving as much capital as possible while providing a high-quality product or service.</p>

<h2 id=""6-equipment-leasing"">6. Equipment Leasing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equipment leasing is a tool where the user pays for the usage of assets but does not take ownership of the asset. By leasing, the lessor transfers the risks of equipment ownership to the leasing company. Therefore focus on using that equipment as a productive tool to grow the business.</p>

3319,"5 Things To Do To Build Your Startup Before Quitting Your Job","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The idea of a startup is not a difficult thing to do than to actually start it. Some people get confused about whether they should quit their job or not before starting a business and end up doing nothing. However, some do start it but have little knowledge about it which makes it a failure afterward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is important to know when and how to start a startup to make it successful in the long run. You need to take care of some things before taking any other action to continue it. Below are some things you should keep in your mind before building a startup by yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. Debunking the Myth</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be a successful entrepreneur you must be completely dedicated to your startup. You must be prepared to work 80-100 hours per work. You must have read statements like the one above. There is an element of truth in the statement however it is misleading at some point. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running a rapidly growing, ongoing business can indeed be very time-consuming. If you aim to be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be prepared for that. By the time your business has ten-full time employees managing the business will also be full time. However, success doesn't come overnight it may require some extra work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. Starting the Buildup</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping your existing job while building your business is a good idea because not only you will be financially secure but the probability of the startup surviving will also get increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should recruit co-founders who also have their existing jobs. You may be able to develop a minimal viable product before you need to think about outside investment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the business bootstraps, the founders can transition from working for a full-time job to working full time for the startup. It will be dynamic and grow more easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. Understanding the Risk</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Risk is an important factor if you want to start your business. Therefore you have to focus on everything carefully to start up your own business before taking another step. Broadly there are 5 types of risks involved-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Product Risk- It includes everything related to your product. Can you produce it effectively and ship it without further inconvenience.</li><li>Market Risk- Can you make your target audience buy your product or get attracted to it. Is there already a market for the size of business you want to create.</li><li>Business Model Risk- Is your product capable to make money out of your business. Are you offering a product that can create a successful business.</li><li>Execution Risk- Can you meet your product deadlines and ship them on time. Do you know how to develop your resources for the best return.</li><li>Team Risk- Do you have the right people or team to improve the performance of your product and business.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All these risks are important and should be taken care of equally. If you can eliminate all these risks by preparing a master plan and execute it properly then you are all set to <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/product/startup-india-registration/""><strong>start your own business</strong></a> without thinking any further about its sustainability of it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. Backup Funds</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/contact-us/""><strong>you start a business</strong></a>, you are most likely to be dependent on your own. So to be well prepared for everything that comes your way in the future create a backup fund. Save some money for the time you think you can't continue your job to provide you with financial stability without getting worried about failures. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through this, once you have accomplished something, you can leave your job and continue your business with the remaining funds you have saved for yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>5. Avoid Getting Defensive</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you are getting feedback on your business idea, let people say everything they want to. Do not act on it no matter how positive or negative they are about your approach. Do not interrupt them in between or start an argument to prove yourself right. Some might give you worse advice but the others can be a good help to you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not try to sell them on your idea because convincing yourself won't lead to many sales. Listen to whatever suggestions they give you as this is a golden opportunity for you to work on yourself and your business. </p>

3324,"Women Entrepreneurship In India","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women entrepreneurship may be defined as a woman or a group of women who initiate, organize and run a business enterprise. The government of India has defined women entrepreneurs based on women's participation in equity and employment in a business enterprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women enter entrepreneurship due to economic factors which pushed them to be on their own and urge them to do something independently. Women entrepreneurs constitute 10% of the number of entrepreneurs in the country. This has been significant growth in self-employment of women now starting new ventures at three times the rate of men.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""1-push-factors"">1. Push Factors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Push factors are elements of necessity such as insufficient family income, dissatisfaction with salaries job, difficulty in finding work, and a need for a flexible work schedule because of family responsibilities. These factors may have more importance for women than men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""2-pull-factors"">2. Pull Factors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Factors that work as entrepreneurial drive factors relate to independence, self-fulfillment, desire for wealth, power, social status, co-operation and support of family members, and a strong network of contacts. The most prominent factor is self-achievement expressed in terms of challenge. It helps women to start, run their own business, and turn it into a profitable venture. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a strong need for achievement could not be fulfilled through a salaried position or when there was a desire to transform a perceived opportunity into a marketable idea, then these factors work for a person to start their venture.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""steps-taken-away-by-indian-government"">Steps Taken Away By Indian Government</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The growth and development of women entrepreneurs are required to be accelerated. Because entrepreneurial development is not possible without the participation of women.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, a congenial environment is needed to be created to enable women to participate actively in entrepreneurial activities. There is a need for government, non-government, promotional, and regulatory agencies to come forward and play a supporting role in promoting women entrepreneurs in India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The government of India has also formulated various training and development cum employment generations programs for women to start their ventures. The programs are as follows-</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India is a male-dominated society and women are supposed to be economically and socially dependent on male members. Women entrepreneurs faced a lot of problems like lack of education, social barriers, legal formalities, high cost of production, lack of self-confidence, etc. Various factors like push and pull factors influence women entrepreneurs. The government takes various steps the uplifting women entrepreneurs in the five-year plan. Women have the potential and determination to set up uphold and supervise their enterprise in a very systematic manner. The appropriate support, and encouragement from society, family, and the government can make these women entrepreneurs a part of the mainstream of the national economy. They can also contribute to the economic progress of India.</p>

3328,"3 Hard Facts You Should Know About a Startup Team","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past decade, we have witnessed a surge of interest in how to <strong><a href=""https://juststart.co.in/"">manage startup companies</a>.</strong> Popular methods have had a fundamental impact on new ventures across the world describing how to develop minimum viable products, how to find product-market fit, and how to pivot a business. However, the core reason why many startups fail is not because of problems in their business, it is rather because of problems in their teams. Among venture capitalists and across different surveys, venture capitalists attribute between 60-65% of failures to problems within the startup team. Yet, there is a noticeable lack of practical advice on how to successfully manage a startup team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A startup team is broadly defined as two or more individuals who commit to each other to create a new firm. Startups come in many forms. Most are small-scale businesses that never intend to become more than a source of income for the founding team. Understanding what makes these teams come, work, and stay together is an important aspect of entrepreneurship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""1-they-are-birds-of-similar-feathers"">1. They are Birds of Similar Feathers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most startup teams are homogenous meaning that team members share similar attributes, skills, and characteristics. This is well established across different samples of startups. In a recent study, it was found that almost 30% of startup teams are composed of individuals who share the same occupational experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also seen homophily being put to practice in several well-known startup teams. For example, Snapchat was founded by three young men all graduates of Stanford University. Facebook was formed among a group of roommates at Harvard University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, such homogeneity might seem surprising. With their ambitions to innovate and explore new business opportunities, one might expect the entrepreneurs to team up in heterogeneous teams to improve creativity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However. homogeneity often makes the startup function more smoothly. In general, homogenous teams tend to perform better than heterogeneous ones. They are better at solving complex problems which makes them productive in managing different conflicts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""2-their-only-constant-is-change"">2. Their only Constant is Change</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Managing a startup is about managing change. The process of a startup is very smooth, but the team needs to constantly revisit assumptions about their product and customer for granted. A study has found that almost half of startups change their initial business idea. For example, Youtube was first launched as a dating site but now is a video streaming platform for various users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the team develops and gets mature, it requires some new skills to have better performance. Some old members exit and the new members replace them to provide the output. However even the ones who stay have different responsibilities, positions, and boundaries. In the beginning, some members might take on a wide range of tasks. But there comes a time when there is a need for role specialization where some members have to step back while the others want to step up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Startup teams deal more with change than stability. But some startups are rigid and thus struggle to adapt to the roles and responsibilities. Therefore, it is important to incorporate change in work practices. To avoid falling apart in times of change, a startup needs to have necessary discussions rather than making number games where individuals fight for a larger pie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id=""3-emotion-is-the-glue-that-keeps-them-together"">3. Emotion is the Glue that Keeps them Together</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entrepreneurship requires persistence. Hence the entrepreneurs who pursue their goals, believe in their abilities and has a passion for the company have a high percentage to be successful. For example, FedEx was a company that was about to go bankrupt but survived merely due to the founder's persistence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, entrepreneurs should also be persistent in terms of their teams. When the time gets tough, it's easy to blame others for the failures. But for a team to work together members must persistently keep together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many issues strain commitment i.e. time and stress. Commitment is easier in the early phase of development but as you grow into another stage you see a lot of challenges like quarrels, low sales, product delay, higher demands from investors, stress, etc. It can be prevented by having strong managers who force persistence upon the team through different contracts and salaries for better performance and loyalty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the three things one should know about startup teams. Knowing these things is important because it helps to understand how the startup team function. This is important for entrepreneurs themselves who look to form the best team possible and to develop that team into its full potential. It's equally important for external shareholders whether venture capitalists, potential alliance partners, or incubator coaches. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If an investor is about to spend time and money in such an uncertain endeavor as a startup, he or she ought to be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the team that is supposed to make it happen.</p>

3380,"5 Growth Stages of a Small Business","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a <a href=""https://juststart.co.in/""><strong>small business develops</strong></a> it moves through five growth stages each with its distinctive characteristics. Because the transition from one stage to another requires change, it will be accompanied by some crisis or another. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crises tend to be disruptive and the problems of change can be minimized if the managers are proactive rather than reactive. Prior knowledge of what generates crises and what to expect in each stage will smooth the process of change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""stage-1-existence"">Stage-1 Existence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this stage, the main problem of the business is obtaining customers and delivering the product or service contracted for. Among the key questions are can we get enough customers, and deliver our product. Or provide services well enough to become a viable business? Can we expand from one key customer to a much broader sales base?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The organization is the simple one the owner does everything and directly supervises subordinates who should be of at least average competence. Systems and formal planning are minimal to non-existent. The owner is the business that performs all the important tasks and is the major supplier of energy, direction, capital, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies in the existence stage range from newly started restaurants and retail stores to high technology manufacturers that have yet to stabilize either production or product quality. Many such companies never gain sufficient customer acceptance or product capability to become viable. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""stage-2-survival"">Stage-2 Survival</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In reaching this stage, the business has demonstrated that it is a workable business entity. It has enough customers and satisfies them sufficiently with its products or services to keep them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key problem thus shifts from mere existence to the relationship between revenues and expenses. The main issue will be can they generate enough cash flow to stay in the business. Or can we generate enough cash to break even and to cover the repair of our capital assets as they wear out?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the survival business, the enterprise may grow in size and profitability. Or it may, as many companies do remain at the survival stage for some time, earning marginal returns on invested time and capital. Therefore go out of business when the owner gives up or retires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""stage-3-success"">Stage-3 Success</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The decision facing owners at this stage is whether to exploit the company's accomplishments and expand. Or keep the company stable and profitable providing a base for alternative owner activities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this stage, the owner consolidates the company and marshals resources for growth. The owner takes the cash and the established borrowing paper of the company and risks it all in financial growth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the business matures, it and the owner increasingly move apart to some extent because of the owner's activities elsewhere and to some extent because of the presence of other managers. Other owners choose this route if the company can continue to adapt to environmental changes. It can continue as is be sold or merged at a profit or subsequently be stimulated into growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""stage-4-take-off"">Stage-4 Take off</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this stage, the key problems are how to grow rapidly and how to finance that growth. The most important questions are will there be enough to satisfy the growth of the great demand brings. Or can the owner delegate responsibility to others to improve the managerial effectiveness of a fast growing fast-growing and increasingly complex enterprise?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The organization is decentralized and at least in part, divisionalized usually in either sales or production. The key managers must be very competent to handle a growing and complex business environment. The systems strained by growth are becoming more refined and extensive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both operational and strategic planning is being done and involved specific managers. The owner and the business have become reasonably separate yet the company is still dominated by both the owner's presence and stock control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""stage-5-resource-maturity"">Stage-5 Resource Maturity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies that have the advantage of size, financial resources, and managerial talent will be a formidable force in the market if they retain their entrepreneurial spirit. Each stage is characterized by an index of size, diversity, and complexity and is described by five managerial factors- managerial style, organizational structure, the extent of formal systems, and the owner's involvement in the business. </p>

3391,"Management of Outsourcing In Startups","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outsourcing is a practice that companies use to externalize parts of their business to an outside partner or partners. By outsourcing, companies can gain cost advantages as well as increased sales opportunities, access to new expertise, lower annual costs, and more time to focus on core business strategy. It can also provide competitive advantages. It can be viewed as the practice of converting fixed costs to variable costs. By outsourcing certain manufacturing and production, a company can then focus on activities closer to its customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""benefits"">Benefits </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main benefits are-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>An increase in competitive advantage through cost reductions.</li><li>The motivation to focus on core activities.</li><li>Access to knowledge and resources in the suppliers market.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suppliers can produce cheaper goods and services through the economics of scales because they have much of their capital invested in machinery and other fixed assets. The company requires less investment in machinery and warehousing and can also employ fewer people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although outsourcing can provide significant benefits, there is always a threat to a competitive advantage when activities are outsourced. A survey of outsourcing costs expressed as a percentage of revenues revealed that as much as 50% of some company's revenue is spent on outsourcing. This fact should be considered while decisions are taken. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, when documents and drawings must be translated, language, problems, and misaligned goals create high risks. Product quality may also suffer if the supplier chooses cheap labor. Travel and other transportation costs can also be significant when outsourcing. These problem areas should also be investigated before making a decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""risks"">Risks </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While more and more companies recognize the value of outsourcing some qualities, each company must consider how the entirety of its business is affected by an outsourcing decision. The problem is that many companies tend only to see the benefits of outsourcing and overlook the risks. They do not evaluate the extent of the risk based on an evaluation of the outsourced activity/process characteristics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main reason that outsourcing projects fail is that decision-makers have not identified the risks and taken steps to prevent or minimize them. Or they have chosen to outsource the wrong product/process have chosen the wrong suppliers, have overlooked the hidden costs, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 id=""motives"">Motives </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several reasons that company outsource their various activities. Companies may want to focus more on their core business or perhaps compensate for their lack of skills in a certain area. Moreover, companies want to reduce costs and acquire greater flexibility. Some companies want to avoid particular problems although they rarely advertise this reason for outsourcing.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Modes of funding</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Personal Savings-</strong> To start any business you should have some initial savings. The least savings should be manageable for 10-15 months. Pouring your own money into business would keep you enthusiastic to focus and work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Friends/Family-</strong> You can take your relatives’ help in funding. They won’t load you with the pressure of returning interest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Co-founders-</strong> Just like you’re investing your personal money, your co-founders might be ready to do the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seed fund- It’s funding or capital which is relatively a small investment that is used to start a business or to carry it forward. This could be done by friends, family, peer-to-peer lending, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Crowd Funding-</strong> It is a process of raising funds by a relatively large no. of people to invest in your company. This could be of two types- Loan-based– In this, investors get their money back with interest. And, Investment-based– In this, investors get some equity in the company and they could see their value is whether getting higher or lower in the company as per their investments. It’s an easy way to gather money quickly without lots of documentation. Kickstarter, Wishberry, Milaap, Indiegogo, Fundable, CatapoooLt, etc. These are a few known websites where crowdfunding takes place with safety and security.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Accelerators and Incubators</strong> – It’s an organization that helps in the growth of start-ups. They promote the ideas for innovation through funds, mentorship, scholarships, and several support. They are involved with you and they make sure of your growth but they also take equity in your investment for their further profit. But you need to have a valuable plan for the market, only then any accelerators or incubators will invest in your firm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bank loans-</strong> This is the safest. There are several schemes that are launched by the government of India because of the high rise of startups. And to encourage and support them, the government has launched StartUp India Seed Fund Scheme in 2022. Through which they permit 300 incubators to grant help and support 3600 entrepreneurs to grow their start-ups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Foreign Direct Investment</strong>- It’s an investment made by a company or an individual in any company which is located in any other country. It is done for business purposes only. There are two routes involved in this Automatic Route- Through this, you can automatically get funding from any company without any approval documentation by RBI but Government Route requires all the proper documentation of the approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>External Commercial Borrowing</strong>- It’s an instrument or a process that helps the companies of India to raise funds and loans from outside India but in foreign currencies. It is legal in India to raise ESB by startups but under an automatic route and only upto 3 million for the average period of 3 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What should you do to make any investor invest in your firm</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Show them how your idea is so unique, useful, and impactful. how strong &amp; focused your team members are. Show them your plan of utilization of funds. How well you are going to use their money makes a great impact. By the government of India, you could get grants &amp; loans of 20 lakhs to up to 50 lakhs through the scheme Seed Fund. But your company needs to be registered by <strong>DPIIT</strong> and also should not be older than 2 years and there are also a few other requirements that you need to follow.</p>

<p>Social entrepreneurship is a process that contributes to developing society, and community altogether and brings a positive impact on society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Who is a Social Entrepreneur?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any person who aims to change the world for good. He focuses more on sustainable change. People who are willing to bring changes to society, who have the creative mind &amp; innovative ideas. They have a very clear vision of clearing trash from society, that person becomes a social entrepreneur &amp; so continues his entrepreneurship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is someone who takes accountability to contribute to dissolving social problems. His area of interest is always towards developing society &amp; less towards huge money-making strategies. Social entrepreneurs care more about the benefit of society but it's not like they don't care about profit in business at all. They prioritize development more. They start their business with the vision of social reforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social entrepreneurs work towards social, cultural, and economical changes. These could be done by people who're very very passionate and determined towards their goals. Because change is a long process &amp; only your determination could help you stick to it till the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many social entrepreneurs who have made huge contributions to making this world a better place to live. Such as Bill Drayton, Arunachalam Muruganantham, Scott Harison, Harish Hande, Bill gates, and many such great people helped us in many ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>What is social entrepreneurship?</strong><strong></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A practice that involves innovation to help the society around. This could be done by individuals, groups, or startups. It is environmentally friendly. It creates income as well as benefits society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>How is social entrepreneurship different from typical entrepreneurship?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They both own any business but their mission differs in many ways. The major difference seems when it comes to the goal for their businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><strong>Product and services-</strong><strong></strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typical entrepreneurship focuses on making goods and services which could help them make huge money; profit oriented. Their products are made by looking after commercial markets and also the wants and needs of customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whereas Social entrepreneurship focuses on creating products &amp; services for the betterment of society. Making of their products and services aims to dissolve social problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Probability-</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typical entrepreneurship is designed to turn a high profit. They share this profit with investors and shareholders because companies are accountable to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whereas Social entrepreneurship is mostly Non-Profit Organizations. They very rarely structure their organization as an In-profit Organization and more often donate their profit amount to the cause they support or to the area they work for. They use their profits and earnings to support social causes and for the fulfillment of resources, they need while supporting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Wealth</strong><strong>-</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typical entrepreneurship works well and uses strong strategies to win a good space in the commercial market. This results in creating good wealth and also increasing their market value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whereas Social entrepreneurship also works well for wealth creation. It's not for themselves but for society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Profit, Wealth, or Marketing Strategies are just a tool to support society. Growth and Development are the real profit for social entrepreneurship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Change of mindset, less suffering, developed areas in terms of education and sanitisation, the movement towards dismissing injustice, availability of resources in every needy area, etc. These are the few things that mean success to social entrepreneurs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How</strong> <strong>can one start a social startup?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true,""type"":""1""} -->

<p><strong>Relevance of social startups in today's world-</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our society has changed so much now in terms of education, health care, sanitization, availability of food and water, and many many other things. But we still need more changes around us. There are still people who are less privileged &amp; want someone to help them out. And that's what social startups do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They focus more on underdeveloped communities and enable access to affordable and reliable healthcare to the underprivileged areas and also provide education to poor people at very low cost or sometimes even for free. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social Entrepreneurs make self-help groups,  employment generation, give training for entrepreneurship skills, etc. and encourage people to learn and work to become self-dependent. so basically they try to change the system to make it better and stronger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social Entrepreneurs make changes in culture. They understand their audience and work as per their requirements. They add very meaningful value to the world. Earning money is not satisfactory for them but making better changes is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Few important facts to know before starting social entrepreneurship-</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your idea has to be very different because there are already so many organizations working towards it. You need to stay true to the mission. The journey is not gonna be easy. You may lack funds later so collect funds to sustain yourself for a time being. Make sure you never lack a skilled team. Complications you may face could be overcome. You just need to use great strategies &amp; stay stubborn towards achieving your goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work towards gaining a reputation so that people could trust your organization and join hands with you. It provides flexible work time which is also a very good point.</p>

<p>The sooner you reach a&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://juststart.co.in/"">business startup consultant</a></strong>, the better results it's gonna bring to your business in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Business Startup Consultant</strong> </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A business startup consultant is a person who refers to a third party. Who gives you guidance about how to scale up your businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A consultant helps startups in their faster successes. Because startup owners have ideas and plans but they lack experience. This is why they need someone with practical experience. Someone who has worked on the ground. Someone who will give them expert &amp; effective ideas to execute their plans in a much better way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>A Startup Needs Business Consultants for Further Reasons</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While starting any startup, you will face millions of challenges. And to diminish problems &amp; create success, one hires a consultant.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since startups are new in business they highly want somebody with long-term experience to guide them through the way. Startups have strong potential but when it comes to performance, they do not do well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that's when startups need consultation support.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● Consultation support is what you seek at the beginning of business for its stability.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● Lack of management skills leads to loss. The startup already doesn't have many funds, so they should be using them in the proper ways.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● Consultant guides startup when, where, and how to invest your funds.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● Consultants give them a strong mindset and skillset in an expertise way.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● Consultation support promotes business success.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● They analyze the business environment for you &amp; recommend working accordingly.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>● They help in legally lowering your expenses and liabilities.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A business consultant doesn't only guide startups. But they also help any stable business when they lack any skill. Or getting any loss at some side of their business. Consultants assure advice to startups, stable businesses, and even MNCs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Offers that consultants provide-</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Strategies</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing a consultant builds with clients is trust. And to build that you need to have a specialized degree, certification, long-term experience, clear concept, perspective, and a fresh vision. A&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://juststart.co.in/service/"">startup business consultant</a></strong>&nbsp;reduces the risk of failure or loss and increases the risk of profit or success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consultants study your company's problem in-depth &amp; recommend good strategies for further benefits. This also leads to expansion in business. Consultants know it well from where the problem is arriving. So they make you focus on the problematic things. And teaches you to dissolve it effectively.</p>

<p>Companies hire consultants when they want to know about where they are lacking good business strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>● They analyze target audience &amp; also competitors which makes it easier for companies.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trials &amp; errors are the most common thing in businesses. Especially in startups. But it costs funds, time and so much effort. So to avoid losing it, one must hire a business consultant who will help you succeed sooner and without even losing much!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Business Consultants don't work in your company as an employee (except exceptionals) to maintain stability &amp; success. As you hire them, what they do is-&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>- Collect your documents.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>- Know your company's errors. Ask questions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>- Acknowledge the background of the company.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>- Make Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>- They ensure you're well informed at the end of the time.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which consultants you need for business mostly depends on your niche. You could even hire them for a short period temporarily but startups need them for a little longer period. They are also hired when companies urgently want to know what's the factor which is stopping their business from growing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The foremost motive of the government for bringing GST into the Indian market is to free them from other indirect taxes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As there were so many indirect taxes and Indian citizens weren't comfortable with them. Neither knowledgeable enough about all the 17 indirect taxes. So, the government replaced them all with a GST (Goods and Services Tax). It was implemented on July 1st, 2017. The government aimed to sort the problem for businessmen, consumers, manufacturers, and producers and it turned with good results. It also made international trade flexible. And has a very good impact on the economy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a destination based tax. Which means tax will be imposed on the destination of the supplies of goods and services. With the implementation of GST, the government has decreased corruption practices. GST has a very effective impact on our economy. Its regular practice also makes India a formal economy by counting &amp; collecting every business even the small businesses.</p>
